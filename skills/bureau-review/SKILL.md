Spawn a subagent (smartest model available) to review the diff of uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged). Explain to the subagent only the goal of the changes, not the rationale for the approach chosen. Ask the subagent to look for bugs and analyze if the changes are principled or hacky. It must either approve the changes for commit or surface a list of blockers. Let the user see the feedback before committing.
