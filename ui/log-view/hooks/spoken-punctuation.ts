// Spoken punctuation for voice input: dictating "question mark" should put a
// "?" in the composer, not the words "question mark".
//
// There are two classes of command, because they collide with ordinary English
// very differently. Marks like "comma" and "question mark" convert wherever
// they turn up — saying one by accident mid-sentence is rare enough to ignore.
// Sentence-terminal commands ("period", "full stop", "new line", "new
// paragraph") are ordinary words far too often ("a period of time"), so they
// convert only when they END the recognizer fragment they arrived in. The cost
// of that gate: to get a period you have to pause right after saying it, which
// is what finishing a sentence sounds like anyway. Said mid-flow, they stay
// prose.
//
// The recognizer picks its own fragment boundaries, so the two passes run at
// different scopes: the terminal pass runs inside each fragment, while the
// unconditional pass runs over the joined stream, which is what lets a mark the
// recognizer split in two ("question", then "mark") still be recognized. A
// terminal command split that way is not — by design, since "ends the fragment"
// is the whole signal it relies on.
//
// The matcher is language-independent. Its command data follows the
// recognizer's locale; an unsupported locale leaves the transcript unchanged.
