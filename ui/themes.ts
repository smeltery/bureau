// Theme registry. Each theme is a `data-theme="<id>"` attribute value on
// <html>, plus a `data-theme-mode` ('dark'|'light') for the few CSS rules
// that must branch on mode rather than on a specific theme (lamp glow,
// window day/night, neon sign, diff2html palette).
//
// All ~73 CSS variables are defined per theme. Existing Dark and Light
// values are byte-for-byte preserved from the original styles.ts. New
// themes (Nord, Dracula, Solarized Dark/Light) supply the same shape;
// office-scene props are picked to fit each palette rather than hand-tuned
// pixel-by-pixel.
