import type { ThemeMode } from "../../../themes/index.ts";

// The hospital keeps one identity — clinical green-white by day, the same room
// with the lights down at night — under every theme. Only the mode matters:
// every theme in ui/themes declares whether it is dark or light, and the skin
// follows that and nothing else.
//
// Two maps, because they are read in two different ways. `hospitalSceneVars`
// overrides theme variables the existing scene already paints itself from, so
// the floor and the walls change with no branch in Floor.tsx. `hospitalColors`
// is read by the skin's own drawings, which are not part of any theme.
//
// The derived faces keep the theme's own rule - caps face up and are brightest,
// the left cut and left slab sides face lower-left, their right counterparts
// lower-right and are darkest - and keep the theme's expressions verbatim, base
// colour aside. A var() inside a custom property resolves on the element that
// DECLARES it, and these are declared on the scene container next to the bases
// below, so they mix against the hospital's floor and walls, not the theme's.
