# Source Feature Gap Options

Date: 2026-07-14

This investigation records accepted, rejected, and deferred options from a
source feature-gap comparison. Source behavior was used as evidence;
implementation stays in Bureau naming and architecture.

## Accepted

- One-off scheduled agent messages. Agents can schedule a future message with
  `deliverAt`, including self-reminders, and inspect or cancel their pending
  outbox.
- Browser preview cards. Agents can request a screenshot of a local/private
  development URL and surface it as an image card in chat.
- Codex drift reduction. Bureau should keep the bundled Codex launcher and
  offered Codex model list current enough for the embedded Codex backend.

## Rejected

- Source branding, repository identity, release scripts, and upstream-specific
  infrastructure. These do not fit Bureau's product identity.
- Public-URL screenshotting. Bureau's preview affordance is scoped to local and
  private development servers, not general web capture.
- Silent coercion of preview dimensions or waits. Invalid inputs should return
  an error so an agent does not mistake a changed screenshot configuration for
  the requested one.

## Deferred

- Sender-visible failure notices for scheduled messages that can no longer be
  delivered. The current implementation logs drops server-side; a future change
  can add a first-class sender notification once the agent-state API exposes a
  narrow system-message helper.
- Recurring agent-to-agent scheduled messages. Bureau already has cron jobs for
  recurring work; one-off scheduled messages cover reminders and delayed
  handoffs without adding a second recurrence model.
- Strong browser network isolation for preview capture. The host check is an
  input policy for local/private URLs, not a sandbox boundary for redirects or
  subresources.
- A bundled browser dependency. Bureau uses an installed Chrome-compatible
  browser to avoid increasing package size and install complexity.
