# Bureau

An isometric 2D office UI for managing multiple concurrent Claude Code agents. Each agent sits at a desk in a browser-based office. The core abstraction separates the **agent** (persistent identity) from the **conversation** (ephemeral task).

Read the [design and architecture article](articles/punching-in-building-an-office-for-ai-agents.md) for a full feature overview.

## How to develop

- **Auto-reload dev mode:** `bun run dev`. This runs UI watch-build + server watch-restart together, and live-refreshes local browser tabs on UI rebuilds.
- **Manual fallback:** `bun run dev:manual` (single build + server run).
- **Rebuild UI only:** `bun run build:ui`. This bundles JS, copies `index.html`, and copies `xterm.css` into `ui/dist/`. The server reads from `ui/dist/` on each request — no restart needed. **Do NOT build to `ui/index.js`; that path is not served.**
- **Restart server:** `systemctl --user restart bureau`. This kills the process all agents run on — every active agent session is interrupted. The user will need to proactively continue any in-progress conversations afterward.
- **URL:** http://localhost:4000 (server machine) or http://TAILSCALE_SERVER_ALIAS:4000 (laptop, phone, etc.)
- **Debug agent issues** by reading logs at `~/.bureau/logs/<agentId>/<sessionId>.jsonl` — don't ask the user to copy-paste.
- **Don't ask the user to run commands — just do it.**
- After completing a feature or batch of fixes, offer to the user to commit and push.

## Key decisions (do not revisit)

- Single Bun process (no Node) — serves UI, manages agents in-process via SDK, talks to browser over WebSocket.
- Agent SDK V2 (`unstable_v2_createSession`) with subscription auth. High risk tolerance on alpha API.
- Primarily WebSocket. Lightweight HTTP endpoints exist where needed (e.g. task board API).
- React/SVG for rendering. No Vite. Bun's bundler, manual refresh.
- No database. In-memory state, flat file logs, `agents.json` for persistence.
- 8 desks max. Agent = persistent identity (name, desk, outfit, cwd). Conversation = ephemeral SDK session.
- Agents persist across restarts. Auto-resume last conversation on startup.
- Default model: Opus 4.6. No per-agent model selection.
- SDK spawns CLI subprocesses which inherit the user's global Claude skills and MCP config.
- Not in scope: agent-to-agent communication (but they can see each other's logs), remote agents (we support remote connections via Tailscale instead), a CLI bureau tool.

## Project layout

- `server/` — Bun HTTP + WebSocket server, agent lifecycle, SDK integration
- `ui/` — React frontend
- `demo/` — Standalone demo app sources and build output
- `shared/` — TypeScript types shared between server and UI
- `website/` — Marketing website (Next.js), deployed via Vercel.
- `docs/` — Design documents, plans, and reference material
- `skills/` — Claude Code skills bundled with the project, available to any bureau agent
- `articles/` — Blog-style articles about the project

### Key paths

- `~/.bureau/agents.json` — persisted agent configs
- `~/.bureau/logs/` — agent conversation logs
- `~/.bureau/launchers/` — launcher scripts (cwd workaround for SDK - details in docs/sdk-investigation.md)
- `ui/dist/` — UI build output (gitignored)
