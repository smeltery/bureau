// The app registry - the leaf module behind /api/apps. Names, ports, per-app
// data directories, and the JSON file that holds them. See
// docs/features/agent-apps.md.
//
// Nothing here starts a process. Registration allocates a port, reserves a name
// and issues a hostname label; running the app is the supervisor's job, and the
// registry deliberately persists no runtime state (see AppState in
// shared/apps.ts).
//
// THE INVARIANT IS WHOLE-LIFE, NOT FOREVER. A name and a port are bound to one
// app for as long as that app exists, and there is no verb that rewrites either
// - both outlive bureau's reach the moment somebody bookmarks the address, so
// moving a live app's address is the failure this registry exists to prevent.
// Deleting an app frees both for reuse. What is
// NEVER freed is the app's hostname label: the ledger in apps.json records every
// label ever issued, so a reused name lands on a fresh generation label and can
// never be served at the previous app's origin - which is where a browser still
// keeps that app's service worker, caches and storage.
// Two consequences that read as over-caution until you connect them to the
// invariant:
//
//   1. CORRUPTION FAILS LOUD, NEVER EMPTY. Every public operation - reads
//      included - starts from a validated snapshot, so a malformed apps.json
//      raises `registry_corrupt` and nothing proceeds. The tempting
//      alternative - the load-time catch-and-return-[] used for cronjobs and
//      tasks - is actively unsafe here: an empty worldview would duplicate a
//      live registration, hand a second app a port that is already serving, and
//      then persist the truncated view over the file that still held the truth.
//      Cronjobs can afford it (a lost row is a job that stops firing); this
//      cannot. Validation is per-record AND cross-record (unique names, unique
//      ports), because a set of individually well-formed records can still be
//      an impossible one.
//   2. PERSISTENCE FAILURES PROPAGATE. saveCronjobs-style catch-and-log would
//      report a registration that was never written, or a delete that did not
//      happen. Every write here throws `persist_failed` and the caller answers
//      500 rather than pretending.
//
// Write ORDER carries the same reasoning. Registration creates the data
// directory and then writes the record: a crash between them leaves an orphan
// directory, which is recoverable. Deletion is one write, and the caller
// sequences the rest: the route tears the unit down and revokes the token
// BEFORE calling remove(), so a name is only freed once the app is provably
// down.
//
// A NOTE FOR OLD OFFICES: deletes used to write tombstones to app-history.json,
// which no longer exists as a concept. A leftover file is IGNORED - never read,
// never written, never deleted. Reading it would resurrect the retirement it
// records; deleting it would put a write on a read path (and fail on a
// read-only state dir) to clean up a file that costs nothing.
//
// CONCURRENCY: every operation is fully synchronous, including the bind probe
// (Bun.listen throws synchronously on EADDRINUSE). A register() therefore runs
// read -> allocate -> write without yielding, so two concurrent POSTs cannot
// interleave and hand out the same port. Should any operation here ever become
// async, it needs a mutex - that is the assumption this note exists to flag.
//
// Pure helpers plus an INJECTABLE store (createAppRegistry) so unit tests can
// point at a temp dir and script the port probe, while production uses the
// default singleton over BUREAU_DIR/apps - the shape memory-store.ts uses.
