// The app supervisor - the ONE place bureau touches systemd. Unit generation,
// start/stop/enable, state reads, and journald logs for the apps the registry
// holds. See docs/features/agent-apps.md.
//
// The registry (server/apps/registry.ts) owns names, ports and persistence and
// runs nothing; this module runs things and persists nothing. The only state it
// keeps is a short-lived cache of what systemd last said.
//
// THE ISOLATION RAIL is what shapes this module. systemd is MACHINE-GLOBAL:
// there is one user manager per box, and a unit name is a global identifier
// shared by every process that speaks to it. So an office running against a
// throwaway state root - a test, an isolated instance - could stop, restart or
// delete the units of the REAL office running on the same box. Two mechanisms
// keep that from being possible rather than merely unlikely:
//
//   1. ONE SEAM. Every systemctl invocation, every journalctl invocation and
//      every unit-file write or removal goes through `SupervisorHost`. Nothing
//      else in the tree shells out to systemd. A test injects a fake host and
//      is then structurally incapable of reaching the machine, rather than
//      being trusted not to.
//   2. THE UNIT NAMESPACE FOLLOWS THE STATE ROOT. `bureau-app-<name>.service`
//      is the production namespace and belongs to the office on the default
//      state root. Any other state root gets its own prefix (see
//      unitPrefixFor). That is not a testing affordance bolted on: two offices
//      on one box with different BUREAU_HOMEs hold two different apps.json,
//      and sharing a unit namespace between them means one office's delete
//      stops the other office's app. An isolated instance can therefore boot
//      the REAL server and still be unable to name a production unit.
//
// WHY THE COMMAND NEVER APPEARS IN ExecStart. An app's start command is stored
// verbatim as a free-form shell string ("bun run dev", "npm start && tail -f
// x"), because that is what an agent types. systemd does its OWN unquoting of
// ExecStart - C-style escapes, quote removal, and `%` specifier expansion - so
// interpolating that string would mean escaping it correctly through systemd's
// parser, and any mistake silently mangles the command instead of failing. So
// bureau writes the command, byte for byte, into a launcher script it owns, and
// ExecStart names only that script. There is no escaping to get wrong.
//
// The launcher lives beside the registry state, NOT in the app's own data
// directory: the app can write to its data directory, and a program that can
// rewrite its own launcher is a program that can change what bureau starts as
// it on the next boot. The app's token environment file sits beside it for the
// same reason (the app-token module owns the token itself).
//
// THREE GENERATED FILES PER APP, and they are regenerated on different
// schedules, which is the detail to hold onto:
//   - the launcher and the unit are rewritten whenever the record changes,
//     because they are derived from it;
//   - the token file is written ONCE, at registration, and never regenerated,
//     because bureau keeps only the token's hash and could not reproduce its
//     contents. That is exactly why an update preserves an app's token instead
//     of rotating it on every edit.

// an app author could construct on purpose. A forbidden character makes the two
// namespaces disjoint by construction instead. systemd accepts a `.` inside a

    //   1. THE GENERATED FILES ALWAYS CONVERGE ON THE RECORD. The registry is
    //      the source of truth, so a unit still holding a command the record no
    //      longer has is the one outcome that must not survive this call - a
    //      later `start` would silently run the OLD command. So the write
    //      happens unconditionally, even when the state read before it failed.
    //   2. ACTIVATION INTENT IS PRESERVED, NEVER INVENTED. What was running is
    //      restarted into the new command; what the user stopped stays stopped;
    //      what has come to rest in `failed` stays there until somebody asks
    //      for it. Silently starting something that was deliberately not
    //      running is the surprising branch, and PATCH is not the verb for it.
    //
    // WHY THE STATE IS READ FIRST. After the unit is written and reloaded, an
    // app that never had a unit at all reads `loaded` + `inactive` - exactly
    // what a deliberately stopped app reads. The distinction is destroyed by
    // the very write this method has to make, so it has to be captured before.
    //
    // AND WHY "I COULD NOT TELL" IS AN ERROR RATHER THAN A NO-OP. Doing
    // nothing is a legitimate outcome here (a stopped app), so an unreadable
    // state falling into that branch would be indistinguishable from success:
    // the caller would be told its running app was updated while the app went
    // on serving the old command. It throws instead, which reaches the API as
