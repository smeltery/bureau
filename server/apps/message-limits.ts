// Rate limits for app-to-agent messages. See docs/features/agent-apps.md:
// "A message wakes an agent and burns model tokens. An app in a loop is a
// bill."
//
// TWO LIMITS, BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO COSTS. A burst limit protects the office
// from a hammering caller (the cost is bureau's, and it is paid whether or not
// anything is delivered), and a daily cap protects the boss's model spend (the
// cost is paid only when an agent actually wakes up). They are therefore spent
// at different moments, which is why this is not one `take()`:
//
//   - takeBurst() is called for every syntactically valid request that is about
//     to be delivered, and spends its slot even if the delivery then fails. An
//     app retrying against a stopped agent is exactly the loop worth arresting.
//   - commitDaily() is called only after a delivery the receiver ACCEPTED. A
//     stopped, missing or queue-full receiver burned no model tokens, so it must
//     not burn the app's day - otherwise one app whose agent is down for an hour
//     comes back to a spent budget it never used.
//
// IN MEMORY, AND THAT IS STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN. The counters reset when
// bureau restarts. A restart is a human act (or a crash) that an app in a loop
// cannot cause, so the protection holds for as long as a bill could accrue,
// while persisting it would put a disk write on every message. Nothing here
// claims to be durable, and the report says the same.

// --- constants (plain named values, no env vars) -----------------------------

// Burst: how many messages one app may send in the window. Ten rather than
// three so an event-driven app (a webhook that fires a few times in a row, a
// nightly job reporting several results) does not trip the limit doing something
// legitimate, while a runaway loop still stops within seconds.
