// The certificate ADMISSION gate for app hostnames.
//
// App hostnames sit under a wildcard DNS record, so a TLS terminator in front
// of the office cannot know in advance which names it will be asked to serve,
// and its site block for them terminates TLS on demand. That turns every name
// anyone points at this box into a potential certificate request, which is
// exactly the shape a CA rate limits you for. Caddy's answer is the `ask`
// endpoint: a GET with `?domain=<name>`, proceeding only on a 2xx. This module
// is that endpoint's policy.
//
// MEASURED UPSTREAM, and it decides the whole design: the endpoint is consulted
// before a certificate is obtained AND before one already in storage is loaded —
// so after a terminator restart every live name is asked about again, in one
// burst. A refusal at that moment refuses the TLS handshake even though a valid
// certificate exists. It is therefore a live ACCESS gate, not an issuance hook,
// and any policy that can run out of budget for an established app is an outage
// waiting for the next restart. Two consequences run through everything below:
// an already-admitted label is free forever, and the record of that has to
// survive a restart of the office too — which is why it lives in the registry's
// ledger rather than in memory.
//
// The other caveat, stated because it is invisible otherwise: a refusal cannot
// reach a certificate the terminator already holds in memory. Cutting a label
// off — deleting its app — takes effect at the next cold load, not immediately.
//
// Fail-closed, like the rest of the app-host surface. What passes: the office's
// own host, and a live app's label once that label has been ADMITTED, which
// happens on its first cold load and only if fewer than ten labels have been
// newly admitted in the last hour (registry.ts owns the accounting). An admitted
// label passes forever after. Everything else is refused, and a refusal costs
// the caller a failed handshake and costs us nothing.
//
// Bureau ships no terminator of its own: this endpoint exists for a deployment
// that puts one in front of the office. An office reached over plain HTTP or
// through Tailscale has no app-host domain at all, so the gate refuses
// everything and nothing ever asks.
