// Boot reconciliation for app tokens: make the token store, the apps'
// environment files, and the units that read them agree - once, at startup.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. An app's token is a PAIR - a hash in the store and a
// plaintext in the file the app's unit reads - and bureau can only ever write
// the plaintext once, because it does not keep it. Anything that leaves the two
// halves disagreeing therefore cannot be repaired in flight; it has to be
// noticed and rotated. Several ways to get there, all real:
//   - an app registered before app tokens existed: no hash, no file, and a unit
//     with no reference to one;
//   - a registration whose hash was written and whose file was not (or the
//     reverse), from a crash or a full disk between the two;
//   - a file edited, truncated or deleted by hand.
//
// FOUR FACTS, CHECKED INDEPENDENTLY. A hash, a plaintext, a unit file that
// actually injects it, and systemd having READ that file. The last one is
// separate on purpose: the user systemd manager outlives bureau, so a unit
// written by a previous run whose daemon-reload never completed sits on disk
// looking perfect while systemd knows nothing about it. One reload at the top
// of the pass is what makes the on-disk fact a loaded fact - it changes no
// file, starts nothing, and costs one subprocess on a boot that has apps.
//
// A hash, a plaintext, and a unit that actually injects it. The pair being
// healthy says nothing about the third: registration provisions the token
// BEFORE it installs the unit (a process's environment is fixed at exec), and
// an install that fails afterwards is deliberately allowed to keep the token -
// which leaves a perfectly good pair behind a unit that injects nothing.
// Skipping on a healthy pair alone would make that state permanent, since
// nothing else ever looks again.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: start, stop or restart anything. A running
// app's environment is fixed at exec, so an app whose token was just minted
// keeps serving without it until its next restart. Bouncing apps at boot to
// re-inject is precisely the behaviour the design doc
// (docs/features/agent-apps.md) rejects - it is the reason apps are systemd
// units and not bureau children - and in this slice the token authorizes
// nothing, so there is nothing to rush.
//
// BEST EFFORT, NOT ATOMIC. Two files and a store cannot be written as one
// transaction, so the cleanup after a half-finished provisioning is best effort
// too: revoke the hash, drop the stale plaintext, and let the next boot repair
// whatever that could not. What this guarantees is not "never half-provisioned"
// but "never SILENTLY half-provisioned": every state left behind is one this
// pass recognises and retries.
//
// The pass is ADVISORY: every failure is per-app, logged, and retried on the
// next boot. Nothing here may throw into the boot path.
