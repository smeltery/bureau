// Boot reconciliation for app URLs: make every app's unit declare the address
// the office would give it today - once, at startup.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. An app learns its own address from its environment, and a
// process's environment is fixed at exec. The address itself is DERIVED, from
// the office's public origin and the app's issued label, so it can change
// without anything about the app changing: an operator points a real domain at
// the office and every app suddenly has a URL; the origin moves and every URL
// moves with it; the origin goes back to plain HTTP and no app has one any
// more. Nothing in the registration path notices, because nothing was
// registered - so a pass at boot is the only place the units can catch up.
//
// WHAT IT COMPARES, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT. Only the URL
// assignment: the line the installed unit carries, against the line it would
// carry now. NOT the whole rendered unit. A byte comparison would make this
// pass the general "the unit template changed" repair, and every future edit
// to renderUnit would bounce every running app on the next boot - a much
// larger promise than this pass is making.
//
// UNLIKE THE TOKEN PASS, IT RESTARTS THINGS. It has to: a token can be picked
// up whenever the app next restarts because nothing depends on it in the
// meantime, while an app that has just become reachable at a hostname and does
// not know its own address is wrong NOW. So what was running is restarted, at
// most once each, and what was at rest is left at rest with the new file - the
// same least-surprise rule reinstall follows for an updated command.
//
// NO PERSISTED STATE, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES THE FAILURE PATH INTERESTING. The
// pass knows an app is out of date only because its unit says so, so an app
// whose unit was rewritten and whose restart then FAILED would look correct
// forever afterwards while its process still holds the old environment. That
// is why a failed restart puts the previous unit back: the drift stays
// visible, and the next boot tries again. The one state that cannot be
// repaired that way - the rollback failing too - is reported rather than
// hidden, because it is the only way this pass can go quiet while being wrong.
//
// ADVISORY, like the token pass: every failure is per-app, logged, and retried
// on the next boot. Nothing here may throw into the boot path.
