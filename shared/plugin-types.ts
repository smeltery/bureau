// Plugin contract for bureau's first-party plugin system.
//
// In-process TypeScript modules, loaded by the Bun runtime at boot from
// <bureauRoot>/plugins/ (bundled) or any operator-supplied absolute path.
// Two hooks:
//
//   beforeTurn — may inject a prompt prefix wrapped in per-plugin delimiters.
//   afterTurn  — observes the turn outcome (memory writes, audit, etc.).
//
// This file is the canonical definition for bureau's own use. Plugins
// themselves should NOT import from here — they re-declare these shapes
// locally so the contract can evolve before being published as a package.
// See docs/features/plugin-system.md.
