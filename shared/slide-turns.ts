// Slide Mode turn splitting (design: internal-docs/slide-mode-design.md).
//
// A deck has one position per assistant turn, 1:1 with the conversation. A turn
// is anchored by the `user_message` LogEntry that started it and runs until the
// next `user_message`. This is the SINGLE source of that mapping, shared by:
//   - the server (server/slide-mode.ts) to build the content it formats, and
//   - the client (ui/log-view/DeckView.tsx) to lay out the deck positions.
// Sharing it keeps the two exactly in step — the anchor entry id the client
// requests is the same one the server keys the stored slide on.

import type { LogEntry } from "./types.ts";

  // The `user_message` entry id that started the turn — the stable slide key.

  // The prompt that started the turn (frozen beneath the slide).

  // All assistant text spans in the turn, concatenated (no tool calls/results;
  // those never carry the answer's prose). Empty for a tool-only / interrupted
  // turn.

  // The turn's error text, if it failed. Null otherwise.

// (a system_init banner, say) belong to no turn and are dropped — they are not
// assistant turns. Ephemeral UI markers ("Conversation cleared.") never count.
// The caller passes the log in display order (the client sorts by timestamp

// a turn whose cached slide is VERIFIED — it carries a content digest, so it was
// written by the terminal gate for content that is immutable within the
// conversation. Otherwise request it (a miss, or a digestless legacy record that
// must be reconciled) unless a request is already in flight. `inFlight` is the
// client's in-flight marker, cleared when a slide lands (ready / slide_ready) or
// the request never reached the server (fetch reject), so a turn CAN be
// re-requested later; while a request is pending it dedupes.

// reported failure does, so it stops rather than retries. Either way a failed
// turn comes back only through an explicit regenerate, which retires the mark
// before it asks.

// The ONE exception to "verified means skip": a stored PLACEHOLDER whose digest
// disagrees with the live turn's. That record says "this turn produced no
// answer" about a turn that now has one, so it is provably stale and the client
// must re-ask — nothing else brings the deck back from it (task e9429ef3). It
// stays narrow — placeholder only, not any digest mismatch — so it cannot loop:
// the regenerated record is no longer a placeholder, so even if a client's log
// disagreed with the server's for that turn, the re-ask happens once rather than
// every watchdog window. `liveDigest` omitted (the caller hasn't computed one)
